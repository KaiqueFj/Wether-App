# üìï About this project 

#### This is a project that was requested as an activity for the Mobile Programming module of the Systems Analysis and Development course at Etec Tabo√£o da Serra.

 - Temperature 
 - Climate conditions 
 - Forecasts for the coming days

It is also possible to get the results of a specific location by searching for it in the "Search" tab of the menu.

Another feature is to change the background image according to conditions: day or night.
